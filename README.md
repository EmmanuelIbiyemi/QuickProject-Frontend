# Quick Project

This the ui of the project i was working on using python language for the backend and also for the database creation
Is Just a simple login in and signup in the code both the ui and backend nothing much
Although i never actually put some kind of limit in it such as like you know email must have @ and other stuff just wanted to finisht the project quickly for the boss

# NOTE----

Did not add any keep of retriction or most follow rule for the password did not add anything like a Feild also in the backend. So it's the password that the user inputs that must be their and it is in integer only note in string

# Password in **INTEGER**
